These are various Game Maker examples we've created/gone over in COGS meetings. They should all be able to be run in the free version of Game Maker Studio. Each project also includes a few practice challenge problems (included in the `scripts` folder of the project), with hints and tips to guide you through them. If you're interested in learning Game Maker, give them a try!
